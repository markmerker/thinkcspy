Overview - Computers and Programs 
-----------------------------------------

As you know, there are computers everywhere.  For this course, we are going to concentrate on the thing you are looking at now, your desktop, laptop or pad computer.  Most of what we will learn about it will apply to many other computers, but we will focus on this to keep things (relatively) simple. 

A computer is an electronic device that takes various kinds of **input**, **processes** it, and generates various kinds of **output**.  What could be simpler?  Well, let's explain it a little more.



**Processing**
  At the heart of the computer is a chip called the |NOTE| :notetext:`Central Processing Unit (CPU) .  The CPU reads and executes a set of instructions called a program`.  These instructions tell the CPU how to perform a desired task.  In order to accomplish the task, the computer will need fetch all kinds of information (data), from different inputs, like a keyboard or a mouse.  It manipulates the data, and then generates output, like images  on a screen, or sound from a speaker. 

**Input Devices**
 |NOTE| :notetext:`Input is information or data going into the processor from the user or another computer.`  Some of the devices that can generate input are keyboards, mice, touchpads, microphones, scanners, communication devices, and  storage devices.

**Output Devices**
 |NOTE| :notetext:`Output is data that the computer has created, and sends out to the world: to users, to storage and to other computers.` It does so through output devices such as screens, headphones, printers, storage devices and communication devices.

**Storage Devices**

|NOTE| :notetext:`Storage devices hold permanent copies of the electronic data` that computers use.  Some examples of storage devices are hard discs, thumb drives, CDs and DVDs. The data held on these devices can be movies, songs, documents, programs, and many other kinds computer files.  


**Communication Devices**

|NOTE| :notetext:`Communication Devices allow computer to send information to and from one another.` Examples of these component are  WiFi routers, modes and network connectors.  They send and receive messages, which allow your computer to talk to the computer on the next desk, through a local network, or to computers all over the world, through the internet.
