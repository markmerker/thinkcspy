    / Division 
        Decimal (floating point) division.  Results are **always a float**, even if the operands are both ints.

    // Integer Division 
        The result is always an integer (whole number), and **always rounded down**.  Thus ``100 // 99 `` is ``9``.

    % Modular Division  
        Called 'mod'.  The result is the remainder from integer division. Examples:     ``4 % 3  is 1`` ,  ``100 % 9 is 1`` , ``5 % 5 is 0`` , ``422 % 211 is 0`` , ``423 % 211 is 1``

    Assignment
        setting the value of a variable.  This is done using an equal **=** sign.  Example: x = 12

    Evaluation
        The processes of converting an expression into a final value.

    Expression

    float
        python data type for decimal or floating point numbers.

    Function
        Code that is called using a name, and perenthesis for passing in data. (A more formal definition will come later).
        Functions we have encountered include ``print(),  type(),  abs(), str(), int(), float()``

    import
        A statement used to include a library (or module) in your program. 

    input()
        A function that gets user keyboard input.

    Input Device

    invoke

    Operator
        The symbol ( +, -, *, **, etc.) in an expression that tells what do the numbers.

    Operand
        The number(s) in an expression that the operation requested by the operator is performed on. Example: the 1 and the 2 in "1 + 2"

    Output device 
        A device the computer uses to present informantion to the user.   Example: video screen.
        
    PEMDAS 
        Acronym for order of precedence: **(P**)arenthesis, **(E**)xponents, **(M**)ultiplication and **(D**)ivision, **(A**)ddition and **(S**)ubtraction.

    Precedence
        The priority in which operators are applied when evaluating an expression.    
        
    print
        A python function that sends data to the screen.  (more later)

    Statement
        An instruction that the Python interpreter can execute.
